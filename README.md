## 🔮 Future Plans
- 📍 Integrate **live location tracking** for safe navigation.  
- 📊 Connect real **health sensor data** (heart rate, temperature, oxygen, GSR).  
- 🔋 Add **real-time battery monitoring**.  
- 🖼️ Use **HuskyLens data** to detect and save environmental information in the application.  
- 👨‍👩‍👦 Store HuskyLens data in the app to **reassure families** by showing their loved one’s status and surroundings.
